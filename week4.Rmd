## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r introduction}

# link: git@github.com:JGCRI/gcam-core.git
#there is no pattern in the relation between weather and delay
#there is no pattern in the relation between tailnum and delay
#when the departure is earlier the mean delay is lower. However in summer , the best departure time is later than other three season
```

# the 4 figures show the mean delay of departure time in winter, spring, summer and autumn. It seems the when the departure is earlier the mean delay is lower. However in summer , the best departure time is later than other three season

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
