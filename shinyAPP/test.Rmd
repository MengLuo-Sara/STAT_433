```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown



```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pop, echo=TRUE}

library(maps)
library(mapproj)
source("D:/PHD/Course/STAT 433/homework/week_5/shinyAPP/census-app/helpers.R")
counties <- readRDS("D:/PHD/Course/STAT 433/homework/week_5/shinyAPP/census-app/data/counties.rds")
percent_map(counties$white, "darkgreen", "% White")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
